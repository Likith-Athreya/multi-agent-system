Multi-Agent AI System
An intelligent document processing system that automatically classifies input formats (PDF, JSON, Email) and routes them to specialized agents for extraction and analysis.

Overview
This system implements a multi-agent architecture with:

Classifier Agent: Routes inputs based on format and intent detection
JSON Agent: Processes structured JSON data with schema validation
Email Agent: Extracts information from email content with urgency assessment
Shared Memory: SQLite-based context tracking across processing sessions

Architecture
Input → Classifier Agent → Route to Specialized Agent → Extract Data → Store in Shared Memory
Supported Formats:
JSON: Invoices, RFQs, structured business documents
Email: Customer complaints, business communications, RFQ requests
PDF: Document text extraction (routed through Email Agent)
Text: Regulation documents, general business content
Intent Classification:
Invoice processing
RFQ (Request for Quote) handling
Customer complaint analysis
Regulation document processing
General business communication
